My brief statement,
"With a $20,000 budget I used an EFS file system so I can have a scalable file system so as the business grows, it grows too. I upgraded my Application Load Balancer to a Network Load Balancer for optimum performance. I even used a Dynamo DB complete with Dynamo DB streams, Dynamo DB DAX for complete low latency performance. I even added another layer of cybersecurity called AWS WAF.
